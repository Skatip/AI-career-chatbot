This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that provides **personalized career advice** to students. It integrates a semantic retriever (FAISS) with multiple open-source LLMs — Phi-2, GPT-2, and Falcon-RW — using Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate grounded, safe, and contextual responses.
